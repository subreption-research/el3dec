        The original DSP/signals wizard hippie, main REDACTED dev and all-round decent human being.

        Shifty old man provided assorted Python code, Golay, etc.

        The quiet engineer. Thank you for all your efforts, kid.

        The globe trotting engineer. Godspeed.

        The original group of internet weirdos, and source of all kinds of gnarly things.

    ENICS
        As unfortunate as it is to see your cool drones used for war, we still thank you for
        building an interesting reverse engineering target and promoting STEM activities for
        children in Kazan.

    FSB and co
        Thank you for not inviting us to a Chai-onium-210 tea & biscuits party (yet).
        The good sportsmanship lives on. Do feel free to go after our detractors. Just kidding...
        Maybe?

And most importantly, everyone risking life and limb out there for literal peanuts: You are the ones
who deserve the accolades, not us. A +30% bodyfat prediabetic Metformin rage-fueled engineer
sitting on a gaming chair somewhere should not steal your thunder. And neither shall we. History may
not remember you, but we will (at least until dementia kicks in).

 Если б это было так просто! — что где-то есть чёрные люди, злокозненно творящие чёрные дела,
 и надо только отличить их от остальных и уничтожить. Но линия, разделяющая добро и зло, пересекает
 сердце каждого человека. И кто уничтожит кусок своего сердца?… В течение жизни одного сердца
 линия эта перемещается на нём, то теснимая радостным злом, то освобождая пространство
 рассветающему добру. Один и тот же человек бывает в свои разные возрасты, в разных жизненных
 положениях — совсем разным человеком. То к дьяволу близко. То и к святому. А имя — не меняется,
 и ему мы приписываем всё. Завещал нам Сократ: познай самого себя! И перед ямой, в которую мы
 уже собрались толкать наших обидчиков, мы останавливаемся, оторопев: да ведь это только
 сложилось так, что палачами были не мы, а они.

The following not-so-anonymous contributors for their (sometimes unrelenting) help and decidedly
justifying this release:

    Dedrone
        For motivating us to release this publicly so that no opportunistic commercial vendor
        can peddle their overpriced HackRF/Ettus SDR + Linux SBC wares containing someone else's
        altruistic work (or something that can be done for ~150 USD in COTS parts).

        Apparently the profit of the sale of 3-4 of their sensors was too much to ask to give away
        for the people who made this possible (including those who risk life and limb) after a
        certain prototype had already circulated around. 130mil in funding but you chose nickel and
        diming when you could have actually helped in Ukraine. Next time you poke fun at Russia
        remember at least they put glue on their internal USB connectors. Bonus points for hiding
        the unlawful and unethical access to a prototype that was never theirs to use.

        <REDACTED1> betcha 90% of the 130mil are going into the marketing dept and C-levels pockets
        <REDACTED2> countdown to owned by ru/cn/nk...
        <REDACTED1> did the CEO really try to pull the "i dont earn as much" card? can he do
                    anything other than asking for checks and signing them? serious Q
        <REDACTED2> he can probs get you a rug for real cheap at a bazaar wit dem haggling skillz

    Alex S., "Free Air" and co
        For more or less the same. Hopefully your NSC and "NGO" friends and their bribes can still
        pay your apartment so your girlfriend does not have to.

    Armorum's Kir V. (self-proclaimed "cyber security expert", wannabe SIGINT "operator")
        We are not publishing your full name because we would inadvertently become the reason people
        actually find out you exist, and that's undeserved. We were ignoring your saltiness until
        we found out you have a pet tortoise with a nazi Luftwaffe cross painted on its shell (you
        share the amateur artistic streak with a certain Austrian painter after all) and the rest
        of your (neo)nazi fetishes. Some gents who like potato latkes will remember you.

        A+ for being part of the problem that makes Russia's "denazification" claims a
        half-truth. D- for your Twitter super secret SIGINT commentary and FSB mockery
        (but can't keep your own Gitlab locked down). B+ for the skimask pics with tomahawks. Edgy.

    The rest of opportunistic hacks, media queens, larp-ers, FSB bait, hustlers/wannabe brokers, etc
        BAWK BAWK

 Thank "y'all",
    the "volunteers"
    (intentionally making this infantile, some people don't deserve to be roasted in seriousness)
    *clix*
